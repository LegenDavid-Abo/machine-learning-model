# Lesson 02 — Machine Learning Loan Approval

In this lesson, I built my first machine learning model using real data.

## What I did
- Used Logistic Regression to train a loan approval model
- Learned how models learn patterns from data
- Saved and reused a trained model
- Made predictions programmatically

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing
- Supervised learning
- Model persistence
- Production-style ML structure
